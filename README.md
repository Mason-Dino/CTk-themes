 ## About The Project

CustomTkinter Themes is a github repository that allows a greater customization of themes that allows you to have more control of your CustomTkinter application. To see all pictures of the different themes I developed go to [here]()

 ## Installation

To use the CustomTkinter themes I have developed download the theme file that you want and save it to your project!

1. Download CustomTkinter
    ```sh
    pip install customtkinter
    ```
2. Use the theme you downloaded
   ```py
   customtkinter.set_default_color_theme("path/to/your/custom_theme.json")
   ```
 ## Usage

You can use this repository for your own projects that use CustomTkinter python library. All that I ask is that you give me credit for all the themes except blue, dark-blue, and green themes.
